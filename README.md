m-collections
=============

A toy reimplementation of the Scala collections library

Motivation
----------

I wanted to better understand how the existing collections library works by reimplementing a subset of it.

What does the 'm' stand for?
----------------------------

Nothing. It could have been anything. I just needed a way to disambiguate from the stock collections.
